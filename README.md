# Responsible AI Benchmarking

**Evaluating Gemma LLMs on Fairness, Robustness, Misinformation, and Interpretability Benchmarks**

This project provides a reproducible, open-source framework for evaluating the Gemma family of language models (including 1B, 4B, 12B, 27B sizes, and optionally ShieldGemma 2) using cutting-edge Responsible AI (RA) benchmarks. The evaluation spans four key dimensions: **Fairness**, **Robustness**, **Misinformation**, and **Interpretability** (focused on English).

## Overview

This project provides a reproducible, open-source framework for evaluating the Gemma family of language models (including 1B, 4B, 12B, 27B sizes, and optionally ShieldGemma 2) using cutting-edge Responsible AI (RA) benchmarks.

## Project Goals

Assess Gemma LLMs on:
- **Fairness:** Evaluate bias and stereotype trends
- **Robustness:** Test model behavior under adversarial prompts
- **Misinformation:** Assess factual accuracy and resistance to hallucination
- **Interpretability:** Measure explanation quality and chain-of-thought performance
